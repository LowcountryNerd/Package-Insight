# Deploy Edge Function via Supabase Dashboard - Step by Step

## Step 1: Open Edge Functions

1. In your Supabase dashboard, look at the **left sidebar**
2. Find and click on **"Edge Functions"** (it might be under a menu or directly visible)
3. You should see a page about Edge Functions

## Step 2: Create New Function

1. Click the button that says **"Create a new function"** or **"New Function"** or **"+"**
2. A dialog or form will appear asking for:
   - **Function name**: Type `user-management` (exactly like this, lowercase with a hyphen)
   - Click **"Create"** or **"Continue"**

## Step 3: Paste the Code

1. You'll see a code editor (a big text box)
2. **Delete everything** that's currently in there
3. **Copy the code below** (I'll provide it in the next message)
4. **Paste it** into the editor
5. Click **"Deploy"** or **"Save"**

## Step 4: That's It!

Once deployed, your iOS app will be able to create and delete users!
